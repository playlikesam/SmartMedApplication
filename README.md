# Medical Report Processing App 🚀

This project is designed to process various medical reports, including eye prescriptions, blood tests, and general health reports. In the future, we plan to introduce X-ray reading functionality using advanced AI/ML techniques.

# Tech Stack 🛠️

##### Frontend: React Native with Expo

##### Backend: FastAPI

##### OCR: Tesseract OCR for text extraction

##### AI/ML (Future Scope): TensorFlow/PyTorch for image analysis

##### Database: MongoDB/PostgreSQL

##### Hosting: AWS/GCP

### Get Started 🏁

##### Install dependencies : 

```npm install```

##### Start the app

```npx expo start```

##### Run the FastAPI backend

```uvicorn main:app --reload```

##### Test API using Postman or Curl

```curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/process" -F "file=@path_to_file.jpg"```

### Features 🌟

1. Extracts text from medical reports (eye prescriptions, pathology reports, etc.)

2. Uses OCR for high accuracy text extraction

3. Plans to implement X-ray interpretation in future updates

4. Easy-to-use API for document processing

### Future Enhancements 🚀

1. X-ray Interpretation: AI-powered analysis of X-ray images

2. Better OCR Accuracy: Fine-tuning Tesseract models

3. Multi-language Support: Support for regional languages

4. Cloud Integration: Store and manage medical records securely

<!-- # Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
